# KARMA+ CONFIGURATION FILE
#
# Add the config node 'karma.<GROUP>' in your
# permissions setup for the specified group for them to 
# be recognized as that group in karma
#
# Permissions:
# karma.gift: Give karma to another player (to stop people
#   with lots of alts to quickly gain karma)
# karma.promote.<GROUP>: Give a player enough karma
#   so that they are in that group (replaces /k builder)
# karma.set: Allow access to change the raw amount of
#   karma a player has (like to reward them with karma)
#
# -PUT GROUPS IN DECREASING ORDER- Since 0.3, it doesn't matter :D
